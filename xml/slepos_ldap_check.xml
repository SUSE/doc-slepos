 <title>LDAP Validation and Checking</title>
 <para>
  SLEPOS contains LDAP validation and checking tools.
  Simple validation and checking is automatically performed during
  each <command>posAdmin</command> addition or modification call.
  Full validation is performed during SLEPOS XML import or on
  demand via the following command:
 </para>
 <screen>posAdmin --validate</screen>
 <para>
  There is an important difference between LDAP validation during XML import
  and validation invoked by the <command>posAdmin --validate</command>
  command. If important LDAP objects are found missing during the XML import,
  the missing objects are reported, but the import continues without a
  failure. In contrast, calling <command>posAdmin --validate</command>
  returns an error the first time a file is missing and stops
  validation.
 </para>
 <para>
  Additionally, XML and LDIF files can be validated against the
  SLEPOS database. LDIF files can be validated using the following
  command:
 </para>
 <screen>posAdmin --validateLDIF --file <replaceable>filename</replaceable></screen>
 <para>
  XML can be validated using the following command:
 </para>
 <screen>posAdmin --validateXML --file <replaceable>filename</replaceable></screen>
